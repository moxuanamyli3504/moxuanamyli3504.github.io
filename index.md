## Data Sources and Project Ideas

Here are five datasets I’m interested in exploring, along with ideas for possible analyses.

### 1. Medical Cost Personal Dataset  
**File:** `MedicalCostPersonalDatasets.csv`  
**Description:** Contains individual medical insurance charges along with age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and other demographic features.  
**Project Idea:**  
- Build regression models to predict medical charges.  
- Explore feature importance (e.g., how strongly smoking status and BMI affect costs).  
- Create interactive dashboards showing cost distributions by demographic attributes.

### 2. Wine Quality (Red Wine) Dataset  
**File:** `winequality-red.csv`  
**Description:** Chemical properties of red wine samples (acidity, sugar content, pH, alcohol, etc.) along with sensory quality ratings from experts.  
**Project Idea:**  
- Train classification/regression models to predict wine quality.  
- Perform feature analysis to see which chemical factors most strongly affect ratings.  
- Create visualizations showing the relationships between acidity, alcohol content, and quality.

### 3. Alzheimer Dataset  
**File:** `alzheimer.csv`  
**Description:** Clinical and demographic attributes used to distinguish healthy individuals from those with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease.  
**Project Idea:**  
- Build predictive models for Alzheimer classification.  
- Analyze patterns in cognitive scores and brain-volume measures.  
- Visualize progression trends and group-level differences.

### 4. Uber Trips Dataset  
**File:** `UberDataset.csv`  
**Description:** Ride-sharing trip records including pickup/dropoff timestamps, locations, distances, fares, and ride types.  
**Project Idea:**  
- Analyze demand patterns by time of day, weekday, and location.  
- Build a heatmap of pickup hubs.  
- Forecast high-demand periods using time-series methods.

### 5. Breast Cancer Dataset  
**File:** `BreastDataset.csv`  
**Description:** Diagnostic features used to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on cell characteristics.  
**Project Idea:**  
- Compare machine learning models for tumor classification.  
- Perform feature selection to identify top diagnostic predictors.  
- Build ROC curves and feature-importance plots.
